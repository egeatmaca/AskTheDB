# AskTheDB
Ask questions in natural language and get results from your database.

## Problem
To leverage data analytics in an organization fully, we should engage domain experts in analytics processes as well. Using their domain knowledge, they can ask pretty good questions to data. These questions often lead to valuable and actionable insights. However, most domain experts don't have the technical skills to interact with data and get the answers.

## Solution
A natural language database query engine. Using AskTheDB, users can ask questions in natural language and get results from their databases. AskTheDB does that by translating natural language questions into SQL queries and executing them on the database.
